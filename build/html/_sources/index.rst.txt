.. note::
   Computer programming is a way of giving computers instructions about what they should do next. These instructions are known as *code*, and computer programmers write code to solve problems or perform a task.

   **The end goal is to create something**: that could mean anything from a web page, or a piece of software, or even just a pretty picture. That’s why computer programming is often described as a mix between art and science; it’s technical and analytical, yet creative at the same time.
