.. note:: **What is renewable energy?**

	  Renewable energy is made from resources that nature will replace, like wind, water and sunshine. Renewable energy is also called "clean energy" or "green power" because it doesn't pollute the air or the water.

	  One reason we can't use renewable energy for everything (yet!) is that we can't store up wind or sunshine, the same way we store gas in a tank or energy in coal. In addition, even though costs have decreased very quickly, it is still more expensive to generate electricity with solar or wind technology. However, scientists and engineers are working hard! As a result, costs are steadily decreasing and storage technology is improving steadily as well. Most of those advances are due to fundamental and applied research, in part funded by the government and in part by private companies.
