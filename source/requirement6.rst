.. admonition:: Additional Challenge

   Computer programming requires the understanding of the problem (which usualy requires good math knowledge), and programming skills (as we described in the :ref:`introduction <introduction>`). However, another important aspect of programming is the handling of data. Handling of data includes their storage, organization, and representation on computers. As an additional challenge, learn more about data and how they are represented on a computer.
