Requirement #8: Coding @ life
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

:math:`\boxed{\mathbb{REQ}\Large \rightsquigarrow}` Discuss with your counselor how coding affects your everyday life, and what you have learned while working on this Nova.

.. note:: **What is quantum computing?**

	  Computing as we know it today is based on classical physics, with data storage using a binary system as described elsewhere in this module. However, the world is really governed by the laws of quantum physics and classical physics is just a good *approximation* of how things work in everyday's life. Scientists have realized that by exploiting the properties of *quantum mechanics*, a new ear of computing (known as *quantum computing*) will allow for solving much harder problems much faster. This is a topic of intense development and a nice introduction is provided below with IBM scientists.
