.. admonition:: Fun fact: why is this Nova module called "Hello World"?

   Answer: because writing a code that outputs "Hello World" is usually the first thing any budding programmer starts with!
	 
   Example, in Python:

   .. code:: python
		   
      print ("Hello World\n")

   And the output on the screen is:

   .. code::

      Hello World
   
.. attention:: Once you have completed this requirement, make sure you document it in your worksheet!
